The instructions for each homework are provided in place. We will be programming in Python 3.5 or 3.6.
Yet again we will enforce PEP8 coding conventions. There is a data file, 3m1z_SymDock_score.sc in this folder.

Since you will be required to write functions, please be sure to include multi-line descriptions of the function,
specifically what the input parameters are, what the output will be and what the function does.

Also, it would be nice to start including author information at the start of your files.
For example, my files would have something like:
__author__ = "Shourya S. Roy Burman"
__email__  = "ssrb@jhu.edu"
This comes before your import statements.

This homework set covers class deifnitions, importing/using custom classes, exception handling and basic matplotlib plotting.
The recommended order for doing it is:
1. Cylinder.py
2. compare_cylinders.py
3. randint_list.py
4. plot_score_vs_rmsd.py

Hope you have fun doing them!
